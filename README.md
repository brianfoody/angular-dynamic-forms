# angular-dynamic-forms
A model-driven forms framework for AngularJS. The concept behind this is to isolate the logic of our models for testing purposes and allow us to present the model in different views based off this.

Without realising I was zeroing in on the React principles here. I moved away from Angular and on to React a few months after this.
